>My settings for random stuff

The font I use is [**Fira Code Retina**](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with font ligatures turned on

## Includes:

 - Sublime Text 3 packages and settings
 - npm global packages
 - Homebrew and Cask formulae

I'm going to add more global packages in the future, and probably will create a branch for my gaming settings
